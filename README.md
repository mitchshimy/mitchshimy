# 👋 Hi there

I'm a passionate software developer with a practical approach to learning and problem-solving. I specialize in both front-end and back-end development, with hands-on experience using:

- 🧠 JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- ⚙️ Node.js, SQL, React 
- 💡 Tools like Git, VS Code, and CLI utilities

I enjoy:
- Debugging and experimenting with code
- Exploring how systems work under the hood
- Building efficient, scalable, and maintainable solutions

🚀 I'm constantly learning new technologies and refining my skills. I love writing clean, reusable code and contributing to projects that make a difference.
